# codenames

This is a project I made for furthering my education in Javascript technologies.

It uses *request* and *cheerio* to grab and scrape the Intel code names [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_codenames),
an idea I got from one of [@mpjme's](https://twitter.com/mpjme) amazing [funfunfunction](https://www.youtube.com/c/mpjmevideos)
videos.

This version just requires you to have node installed, and is run from the command line
by typing `node app.js` in the working directory.

I wanted to leave this version alone, so I also made a version that uses *express* and
*ejs* that is web deployable [here](https://github.com/amichaelparker/codenamegen). The
deployed app can be found at [Heroku](https://codenamegen.herokuapp.com).
